go to lua/autorun/sh_safezones.lua (you can open it with notepad if you dont have a lua editing program)

you will see this:

SafezonesConfig = {
["ProtectionDelay"] = 3, -- how long will they remain spawn protected after leaving a safezone box
["RemoveProps"] = true, -- do we want to delete props that enter the zones
["RemoveVehicles"] = true, -- do we want to delete vehicles that enter the zones, be careful with this if you run an rp server with cars
["RemoveNPCs"] = false, -- do we want to delete npcs that enter the spawn area
}

Safezones = {
["Box1"] = {Vector(11975, 4788, -410), Vector(11594, 6594, -200)},
["Box2"] = {Vector(6452, 11320, -410), Vector(7684, 12696, -250)},
}



Change config options as needed.  Remember to put a comma after the end of every entry since they are lua tables and will error out if you miss one. eg. ["Box1"] = {Vector(11975, 4788, -410), Vector(11594, 6594, -200)}, <----- THIS COMMA NEEDS TO BE HERE


While ingame you can open console and type safezone_grablocation into it, this will print the location that your crosshair is pointing at.
Then you just copy paste that code into the table and you should be good to go

Additionally, if you wish to override the SafezonesConfig settings PER ZONE, you can modify the safezone to have a third argument, basically a copy of the config but with the changes you want.
For example:

Safezones = {
["Box1"] = {Vector(11975, 4788, -410), Vector(11594, 6594, -200), {
    ["ProtectionDelay"] = 5, -- how long will they remain spawn protected after leaving a safezone box
    ["RemoveProps"] = false, -- do we want to delete props that enter the zones
    ["RemoveVehicles"] = false, -- do we want to delete vehicles that enter the zones, be careful with this if you run an rp server with cars
    ["RemoveNPCs"] = false, -- do we want to delete npcs that enter the spawn area
}},
["Box2"] = {Vector(6452, 11320, -410), Vector(7684, 12696, -250)},
}

Note that this is entirely optional, and if you don't specify it, it will use the default config.


That should be all you need to know, if you have any problems comment on the scriptfodder page or open a support ticket.  I usually don't accept random adds on steam so don't waste your time adding me.
